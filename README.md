## MessageAppProto

This is a prototype secure and anonymous decentralised messaging application that I made as part of my software engineering dissertation (Bachelors)

The purpose of the project was to create an application that does not compromise the users privacy or anonymity, even if the auther wanted to do so for profit they would be unable to due to the decentralised nature.

"Implementation details.pdf" is an extract from my dissertation. It contains code samples and explanations of most classes, as well as class diagrams and an object sequence diagram for each use case.

As far as I know the application really is safe to use, but if you're rooting around the code or running your own tests and discover an issue, please do contact me.
