## MessageAppProto

This is a prototype secure and anonymous decentralised messaging application that I made as part of my software engineering dissertation (Bachelors)

The purpose of the project was to create an application that does not compromise the users privacy or anonymity, even if the auther wanted to do so for profit they would be unable to due to the decentralised nature.

The files contain an extract of the relavent parts of my dissertation, the parts which explain how its implemented, class diagrams, object sequence diagrams, and the testing section.

As far as I know the application really is safe to use, but if you're rooting around the code or running your own tests and discover an issue, please do contact me.
